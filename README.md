# Sandbox
The goal of the sandbox project is to enable teams from across the division to take a new approach to providing government information and services to the public. The team decided to focus on helping scam victims, as that is a common topic on both our websites and our contact center. By the end of FY18, the team hopes to develop takeaways from our research that we can use to improve the publicâ€™s experience when they need to report a scam. We hope to look at solutions based around AI, harnessing data, and coordinating with our contact center.
